## My process
 I began by creating a container class for the card.
 I gave it  margin, padding and border radius. Then I specify the width, inserted the elements inside it ensuring that therre is space between them.

For the image I gave it a border radius to match the one for the container class, a max-width property of 100% to ensure it doesn't overflow

Added flex to  space the two elements inside the body element

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

creating  layouts that are responsive
I also learnt how to utilize the min height in my design
